NOTES: These files are dependent for my scripts to use (some of them anyway) and these files are to be placed in the main game directory with the exe.

My scripts, particulary the ones that print out data via a .txt file write files to the game directory.

Short File Descriptions

- strings.txt
This file is important as it contains all of the strings/names parsed from the game .exe itself as well as from all of the scripts that exist in the game. These names are primarily used for modifying/editing properties.
