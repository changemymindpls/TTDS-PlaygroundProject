# TTDS-PlaygroundProject

## About

This is my personal project using the Telltale Script Editor that I primarily use to test and write new mods or experiment with the Telltale Tool.

## Editing/Modifying

***For Modders/Developers Only***

**You are free to download the source code and edit/use it as you wish using the [Telltale Script Editor](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/Telltale-Script-Editor)!** You can even fork this repository to create your own version of this mod. *Just note to be mindful and edit the .tsproj file to change the author to your name and not mine in notepad or another text editor.*

To Edit/Modify this project, be sure to either download this repository or go to the releases tab and download the "Source code.zip" file (if there is a release). Then extract and open the project using the [Telltale Script Editor](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/Telltale-Script-Editor) and edit/play with the code as you wish!

NOTE: This project was built using the [Telltale Script Editor Alpha 1.1.0](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/Telltale-Script-Editor)
